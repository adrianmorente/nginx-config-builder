server-config-builder
====================

A python library for constructing web servers configuration files. Forked from [linkedin/nginx-config-builder](https://github.com/linkedin/nginx-config-builder) to contemplate other several different web servers besides nginx (such as *Lighttpd*, *apache*, *Caddy* among others).

The configuration, installation and further details will be documented together as development advances.
